Dragon Bot
==========
The Dragon Bot is a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ "Twitch.tv") bot that allows other developers to make plugins and expand it to make it better,
this bot was created with the ideas that [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/ "Spigot's Webpage") was created under. To allow the users to make their
own addons to it to make it fit their needs.

Official Plugins
----------------
These are open source plugins that either I have worked on, or that I've worked closely on with the developers.  
  
- [Dragon Bot Essentials](https://github.com/Dragovorn/essentials "Dragon Bot Essentials' Github") - A plugin aimed at adding 'Essential' functionality to the Dragon Bot

Installation
------------
The only installation process for the bot is to download the latest full release (But Snapshots might have some important bugfixes)

Development
-----------
This portion is going to be pretty watered down, because I want to get version 1.06 fully functional before I write an
official documentation because 1.06 looks like a lot of api changes (With some major front end changes too).

**There currently isn't a maven repo for the Dragon Bot's api**  
The above being said, that means that you have to download the Dragon Bot inorder to write plugins for it.

History
